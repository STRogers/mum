Configuration Documentation for: mumi.json

The mumi.json file will be automatically generated by the `mum install` command and saved to the directory level above your installation target directory.

Assuming your installation target was "/var/www", the mumi.json file would be saved to "/var/mumi.json".

From that point forward, you can simply change directory to "/var" and run `mum update [<version>]` to refresh or update that specific installation.

Each mumi.json file contains an object with two keys:

    source      This is the value of the <source> argument provided to the `mum install <source> <target>` command.
    target      This is the value of the <target> argument provided to the `mum install <source> <target>` command.

Use `mum install -h` for more details on the allowed values for source and target.
